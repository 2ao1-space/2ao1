    "What started as a love for design has turned into a passion for building interactive digital experiences."

  "story": [
    "I was born and raised in a small town in Egypt, and curiosity was my first guide to the world of web development. I knew little, just glimpses, but that curiosity was enough to open a wide door for me that I hadn't anticipated. When I started college in 2019, I had no clear vision for my career path. I thought I'd head toward marketing and advertising, but I found myself returning to web development, as if it was the path I'd been searching for all along.",
    "At first, programming fascinated me. But what truly captivated me was the creative aspect—the colors, the movement, and the fun challenge of building something that combines beauty and function. From there, I naturally transitioned to the world of design, and since then, I haven't looked back.",
    "Once technology and design met in my world, my true journey began. Every question opened three more, and every line of code revealed new possibilities. The road wasn't easy; some opportunities didn't pan out, but I didn't see failure—I saw a space to create my own path. I spent long hours learning, experimenting, making mistakes, and learning again. Guidance, constant curiosity, and a determination to develop myself helped me reach where I am today.",
    "I now specialize in designing and developing responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing web interfaces. I believe that the best digital experiences arise when beauty meets logic, and I'm here to make that encounter feel like magic."

  "beliefs": {
    "beyond coding": "I believe that great work doesn’t come from pressure alone—it comes from passion, curiosity, and the willingness to keep learning, even when it’s uncomfortable. That balance between focus and fun? That’s where the magic happens.",
    "content": "Outside of work, you’ll usually find me recharging—sometimes by taking a quick nap, playing video games, kicking around a football, or simply diving into the latest design trends for inspiration. I enjoy experimenting with creative ideas, whether or not they ever make it into a final project. It keeps my mind fresh and my creativity alive."
